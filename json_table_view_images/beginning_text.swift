Built by Elkhart architect E. Hill Turnock and influenced by the Chicago and Prairie schools of architecture, the horizontality and window grid design are notable. Within, Art Deco style manifests itself in symmetrical, geometric patterns. |Although Samuel F. Spohn intended it as the headquarters for Spohn Medical Company, which manufactured ointments for milking cows, it served a variety of alternate purposes. It was rumored that during his tenure as Mayor, Samuel F. Spohn used the fourth floor as a place for high stakes poker games involving the monied members of the community, despite the illegality of the practice at the time.  The floor below is equally fascinatinga large, restored ballroom. In the teens and twenties, the ballroom was used only sparsely, but in 1932, a former Goshen High schooler, Karl Van Dorston, unable to find work during the depression, requested to use it for performances of a big band. After a thorough cleaning, he and his band drew crowds to dance for almost a decade. Sadly, after the band disbanded, the ballroom was again abandoned, until 1981 for a celebration of Goshens 150th anniversary which lead to its present restoration.|\nCommercial District|The Rowell-Champion House.png|The Rowell-Champion House (1847)|101 N. Third St.|41.586761|-85.836472|||\nCommercial District|Police Booth.png|The Police Booth (1939)|Lincoln and Main |41.586589|-85.835294|A bizarre looking octagon, the Goshen Police Booth certainly stands out. Designed in the Art Deco style, which emphasized symmetrical geometric figures, the bizarre building is crowned by a frieze and firing ports at the top. Similarly, the glass is bulletproof in order to protect from any attackers.||\nCommercial District||||||||\nCommercial District|IMG_5196.png|City National Bank Building (1875)|111 E. Lincoln|41.586599|-85.833904|Once a bank, the building is decorated in the style of the Italian Renaissance Revival, apparent in by the tooth-like blocks decorating the eaves, elaborate supports and the rectangularly arched windows. The cast iron pillars and stairs further reflect this design.| The City National Bank once inhabited this building, evidenced by the safe within which still remains. Organized by Silas Baldwin, a frontiersman, the City National Bank was the first bank which served the city of Goshen. After 25 years of success it was determined a larger building was necessary, so they moved into this building for the next six years, before moving once again. Presently, half the building is now an event space.  |\nCommercial District|Sorg Jewelers.png|Sorg Jewelers (1880)|120 S. Min |41.585697|-85.833772|Immediately, Sorg Jewelers stands out because of its unique neon sign, the only historical neon sign remaining in Goshen. Also notable is its elaborate Renaissance Revival peak which remains in excellent condition with a large medallion at its top.|Not unlike the building itself, the business inside has also stood the test of time. Presently, Sorg Jewelers is owned by the fourth generation of the Sorg family, after being opened over a hundred years ago. It was originally owned by Sigmund Sorg, albeit at a different location. However, the sign and the technique traveled to his descendents and to this building in 1937, and have remained there ever since.   However, this building wasnt always a jewelry store and hosted a number of other businesses as well. For its first 26 years, this building had the much humbler responsibility of being a hardware store, and then a grocery. This didnt last either, and the building changed into a book store, a drugstore and an autoparts store, and ultimately it was abandoned in 1929. That is, until it found its vocation as a jewelry store in 1937.|\nCommercial District|Harper Block.png|Harper Block (1888)|124 S. Main |41.585559|-85.833658|Harper Block is a fine example of Renaissance Revival architecture. This is reflected in the decorative peak which includes the buildings initial name alongside a low pitch roof, and ornamental caps(pediments) atop the windows. Indeed, this style was common for stores in the nineteenth century. |The Harper Block was initially owned by Charles Harper a well remembered and successful shoe salesman. After serving in the Civil War, Harper worked for a Goshen resident and opened up a store in Millersburg, before returning to Goshen. Here, he purchased the Harper Block and operated a shoe store out of it for nearly thirty years. Around this time, it was sold to the Charles Granville Adams family, who utilized it to sell dry goods and clothing items for a century. Indeed, within the building has preserved the original tin ceiling as well as the old store layout.   Beneath the ground is a large basement which stretches out underneath the sidewalk. This was not uncommon for buildings of the early 20th and late 19th centuries, as many had entrances through the basement, and the Harper Block was no exception.   Part of the reason for the buildings preservation is that the present proprietor is the Goshen Historical Society, which purchased the building after the Adams family left, and placed a museum within. Indeed, you may visit whenever it is open, which is on Saturdays and the First Friday of each month, or by appointment (574-975-0033).|\nCommercial District|IMG_5228.png|Queen Anne upper facade|129 S. Main |41.585351|-85.834313|This beautiful building reflects the grandeur of Goshens main street. The enlarged eaves, tooth-like brackets (dentils) and medallions are characteristic of its ornate Queen Anne style. Also notable are the pilasters which frame the decorative leaded glass windows of the second floor, which presently is a loft.||\nCommercial District|Jefferson Theater.png|Jefferson Theater (1905; rebuilt after fire 1907)|210 S. Main |41.584622|-85.833953|Over a century ago, the Jefferson Theater was the foremost location for theatrical productions. The marquee serves as a reminder of that era and as an entryway to incredible architecture. The interior was designed in the style of Renaissance Revival with a gorgeous arched ceiling and a curved balcony. |Finished in 1905 for stage performances, the Jefferson theater quickly became popular. Sadly, just a year later, it burnt down, only to be rebuilt in 1907. By 1912, the theater began showing films which would draw people from all over Goshen.  It was filmed itself in 1925 for the motion picture A Day in Hollywood. Later that same year the film debuted, and the crowd was so large that over half of the people in line had to be turned away from the film. In 1948, the name of the theater was changed to the Goshen Theater, so that it might better fit on the Marquee. Just under four decades later, it was discontinued from use as a theater, and reopened as a church by the Word of Life Fellowship. Presently, it is owned by a non-profit which is looking to restore the theatre for live performances as it was a century ago.|\nCommercial District|Ignition Garage.png|Ignition Garage |120 E. Washington |41.584883|-85.833245|||\nCommercial District|The Kerstetter House.png|The Kerstetter House (1868)|311 W. Main |41.583168|-85.834759|Although it has been greatly altered, the Kerstetter House remains an architecturally significant house. Originally built in the Second Empire style in 1868, its tall nature and mansard roof remain major characteristics of the building. In 1904, a curved porch was added, further changing the homes appearance.|The original residents of this home were Chauncey and Mary Kerstetter; Chauncey was (as indicated by the opulence of the home) a successful businessman working as a jeweler and a druggist. Apparently, he brought his work home with him, because it was commented that the house would be filled with many fine sodas when it was eventually built.          The Kerstetters owned it for a little over a decade, and then it exchanged hands between a set of owners, before being purchased by Ephraim Culp. Mr. Culp worked as an undertaker for many years and built the first funeral carriage in the state of Indiana; as such he changed the building from a home to a funeral parlor. In characteristic fashion the home stayed in the family as did the business, until 1964 when it was acquired by the present owners Rieth, Rohrer and Ehret Funeral home in 1964. |\nCommercial District|Goshen Brewing.png|Hydraulic Canal central Generating Station (1915)|315 W. Washington |41.585419|-85.838261|The Hydraulic Canal Generating Station was an industrial building used as a steam plant by the Hawks Electric company. It later was utilized by the Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) and helped to generate power to Goshen for many years. Presently, it has been renovated into a brewery and pub.|The Hydraulic Canal Generating Station was constructed due to the immense popularity of the power being generated from the Tailgates on the canal. The Hawks Electric Company was having trouble providing electricity for the town and Hawks mills simply from water power, and as a result determined that the construction of a steam powered plant would be a wise and profitable investment. Indeed, it proved to be an excellent and necessary facility as even after the Hawks brothers sold the building to NIPSCO, NIPSCO kept it in use for many years afterwards.  |\nCommercial District|Tailgates Building.png|Tailgates Building (1898)|302 W. Washington |41.585013|-85.837627|The Tailgates building was for nearly two decades the heart which provided Goshen with power. Controlling the flow of water from the Millrace Canal into the Elkhart River, it also served as a hydroelectric power station, providing the cities businesses and surrounding areas with the energy needed to keep industry moving.|The Tailgates building was owned by the Hawks Electric Company owned in turn by the Hawks brothers. Initially they intended to provide power only for the Hawks Mills located along the millrace. However, the Hawks brothers quickly realized they could sell the extra power generated to the city and enhance their own profit. But electricity became so popular for businesses and residencies that the Hawks brothers had to find a way to produce more electricity if they wanted to sell to members of the city and power their mills. As a result they created the Hawks Electric Company and built a number of other buildings to provide electricity.          The Tailgates building was owned by the Hawks Electric Company for many years, and helped to power Goshen until the 1920s. Shortly thereafter it fell into disrepair. However, it has recently been restored by the city and within one can see some of the original equipment that was once there. Also notable is the sculpture Dream Chaser by Goshen based artist John Mishler. |\nCommercial District|Lumber Complex.png|Lumber Company Complex (1875)|212 W. Washington |41.584642|-85.836947|The Lumber Company Complex reflects Goshens history as a furniture producing city. A collection of shed-like buildings, the complex reflects the industrial nature of the canal rather than a particular architecture style. Although it was originally owned by Goshen Furniture company, lumber businesses also acquired workshops there.|Lumber businesses were an important part of Goshens industry in the late 19th and early 20th century, with many men (e.g. John Lesh, John Penrod) getting wealthy off of their success. Indeed, many of these lumberyards and mills would be built along the hydraulic canal because this was an efficient and effective way of transporting wood and it provided a source of power to run mills and industrial equipment. Ironically, the building of industry near the water also allowed for it to expand beyond it. These companies soon realized they could make money by generating electricity and power from the water and selling it to other businesses. With electricity and power, businesses no longer needed to be located near the canal, and were able to spread farther out and away from water. Since that time the Lumber Company Complex has been renovated into the Goshen Farmers Market, a bakery, and a number of other buildings for the arts.|\nCommercial District|The Hawks Building.png|The Hawks Building (1904)|214 W. Jefferson |41.583470|-85.837104|A factory building, the Hawks building was designed in 1904  with more concern for function than for form. But it served its function well, serving many different manufacturing enterprises over the course of its use. |As reflected in its name, the original owner of this company was the Hawks family, who were involved in a series of companies from mills to power. This building was built as a place to manufacture and assemble furniture such as bedsteads, tables and chamber furniture. For many years the Hawks Building produced furniture, until the Hawks family determined it was unprofitable.  Eventually, the building changed corporate hands and was owned by Barler Metal Products, Inc., a company which produced, unsurprisingly, metal goods. Indeed, they managed a large interstate business which designed metal cabinets for a variety of circumstances. After a while, they became unprofitable as well. More recently, the Hawks building has been renovated into an affordable housing unit for entrepreneurs and artists.|\n||||||||\n||||||||\n||||||||\nResidential District |IMG_5194.png|The Shoots Building (c. 1880)|112 E. Lincoln |41.586184|-85.833829|The Shoots Building, built in 1880, was designed in the Renaissance Revival style. This is evident from the large  overhanging roof and the dentils decorating beneath it. Similarly, the columns indicate its architectural clade. Notably, it had the first service elevator in the city of Goshen.|The Shoots Building can hardly be traced to a single business however. Indeed, it first opened as a hardware store in 1886, but in just six years it became much more than that: it was a hardware store and a saloon and carpet store. For the next thirty years it would lead an interesting life, serving as a cigar shop, plumbing shop, tin shop, a Saloon once again, a hardware store with a restaurant and a phone exchange before returning to merely a hardware shop in 1926. Indeed, after all these changes, the Shoots Building was relegated to being an office building for many decades. It remained as such until 2007 when LaCasa purchased it and changed it into an affordable housing unit.|\nResidential District |IMG_5204.png|The Hattle Hotel (1890)|210 E. Lincolin |41.586145|-85.832356|The Hattle Hotel has been restored to its former Italianate grandeur. The neo-renaissance style can be seen in the emphasized overhanging eaves supported by large corbels, tall windows. Within are eloquently curved staircases and impressive decorations. Presently it has been converted into an affordable housing complex. |Despite, or perhaps due to its beauty, the Hattle Hotel was a site of numerous scandals. Before its construction, the only building there was a livery, a stable for horses of visitors to Goshen. However, eventually a hotel was built there for those same visitors to stay in as well. At first, it was operated as two separate hotels, but then merged into the Hotel Hattle. In 1917, it was embroiled in scandal after the wife of the manager caught her husband having an affair with a maid; leading her to get him arrested for improper conduct.   However, the Hattle also took part in a more positive scandal; for much of the 20th century Goshen operated as a sundown town, where contracts were used to prevent African Americans to stay in the city and businesses like hotels elected not to serve them. However, in the early sixties, the Hattle Hotel was the only hotel which served African Americans out of the other four in Goshen. In this way, it scandalized the town for the better.|\nResidential District |IMG_5202.png|First Presbyterian Church (1861)|215 E. Lincoln |41.586732|-85.832387|The First Presbyterian Church holds a significant claim in a city of many churches: the first steeple. Built in 1853, the steeple and tower on which it rest is reflective of its Gothic Revival style. Also from this are the tall, narrow windows peering into the church.|The Presbyterian church has a deep roots in the town of Goshen. Only a year after citys founding in 1831, the first Presbyterian sermon was preached in another church in Goshen. However, there was no consistent pastor who spoke, until 1852, when a preacher, Rev. H.L. Vannuys, came to Goshen by coach and asked an important member of the church if he could preach. He was accepted, but at that time the Presbyterian church was in disarray; apparently the day before the door of the church had been left open and a flock of sheep had slept there the night before. However, arrangements were made, and Rev. Vannuys preached in the courtroom. Indeed, his sermon was so successful that the congregation determined that if Rev. Vannuys would stay and preach, they would build a formal church. Rev. Vannuys agreed and as a result, fundraising began, By 1853 the church was completed.|\nResidential District |IMG_5206.png|Post Office (1913) |311 E. Lincoln |41.586491|-85.830559|The Old U.S. Post Office is elegantly designed in Neoclassical style. Outside there are eight pilasters, or ornamental column-like decorations. Between the pilasters are tall windows surrounded by arches capped with a keystone at the top. Within is a colonnade and a high domed ceiling.||\nResidential District |IMG_5226.png|The Lesh House (1879) |313 E. Lincoln |41.586909|-85.83046|This Italianate building may not look like much now, but it once was the luxurious home of the lumber baron John Lesh, known as the King of the Walnut Business. Large bay windows with elaborate decorations indicate its greatness. Sadly, it now lacks the wraparound porch which completed the building.|Lesh was immensely successful in the lumber trade, operating in almost all the states and territories which surrounded Indiana, primarily due to his great efficacy as a businessman. Indeed, there are stories of him cleverly playing two of his suppliers, F.P. Abbott and John N. Penrod, off of each other, with Lesh telling each of them that the other was nearly about to out-produce the other. However, as they both did exceedingly well, he elevated both of them to partners in his company.  Indeed, this involvement in business with F.P. Abbott helps to explain another significant occasion at this home. In 1911, American playwright, short story author and journalist Ring Lardner was married to Ellis Abbott at the Lesh House. Abbott was of course none other than the daughter of F.P. Abbott. Similarly, another important historical figure was entertained here, James G. Blaine, the Republican candidate for president in 1884 running against Grover Cleveland.|\nResidential District |IMG_5201.png|First Reformed Church (1893) |110 S. Fifth St. |41.586134|-85.832671|The stained glass windows of the former First Presbyterian Church are eye-catching, with beautiful decorations. Built in the gothic revival style, with a small parapet overhanging the entryway and a hall-like design for the sanctuary. The entrances themselves are more resemblant of romanesque architecture, with arches serving openings to the church.||\nResidential District ||The Dale House (1890) |114 S. Fifth Street |41.585625|-85.832537|The elegant Dale House is one of the finest personal residences in Goshen. Designed in Neo-Jacobean style, an American modification of Queen Anne style, this is reflected by the eight-sided tower, numerous oriel windows, and slate roof. Also notable are the stained glass windows and many gables which fill the front of the house.|The Dale House was originally constructed by a wealthy dry-goods merchant, J.M. Dale, who supposedly built it because his wife liked Neo-Jacobean architecture. Supposedly, the home was one of the first to be electrified in Goshen. It also served as the site of a party for the then Postmaster General John Wanamaker. Mr. Wanamaker had arrived to give a speech, and was received by a collection of Goshen dignitaries including Mr. J.M. Dale and the lumber baron John H. Lesh. In particular, he was familiar with Mr. Dale from his own forays into the dry goods business, and as such he was thrown a lavish party with a six course meal. Mr. Wanamaker reciprocated providing the family with crystal candlestick holders.|\nResidential District |IMG_5212.png|The Carnegie Library (1903)|201 S. Fifth St.,|41.585059|-85.832993|The Carnegie Library is one of the finest buildings in Goshen, designed in neoclassical style, and the first Carnegie Library in Indiana. The pillars and windows reflect the classical style, alongside stone carvings and gorgeous bas relief sculpture. Within is a central rotunda and a gorgeous stained glass dome.|The Carnegie Library was not simply the product of a wealthy philanthropist, but rather the work of womens literary societies as well. In the late 19th century, not unlike today, women would gather to hold studies of particular books. In doing so, Goshen women became aware of a problem: the lack of a library. To remedy this, they began fundraising efforts and created a private library of which people could become members in order to borrow literature. With all the money they raised they were able to purchase around two thousand books.   However, they determined that a public library would be much preferable to a private one, so all of Goshen could benefit from these books. As a result, they wrote an entreaty to Andrew Carnegie noting the large percentage of readers in the small town of Goshen. Carnegie quickly agreed and helped fund the construction of the library which was built in 1903. The library operated as such for 65 years, and would later become insurance offices. In 2000, it was purchased once more by the city and is used presently as municipal offices. As a result, visitors are welcome to look inside on the weekdays.|\nResidential District |IMG_5221.png|First United Methodist Church (1875)|215 S. Fifth St.,|41.584501|-85.832947|The castle-like First United Methodist Church is a perfect example of Gothic revival architecture. The sanctuary recalls the architecture of noble halls, and the octagonal towers, medieval walls. With pointed archway entrances and buttresses, the church elegantly reflects the influence of the middle ages in its design. |Methodism has a long history in Elkhart county, with many of the earliest residents being Methodists and Presbyterians. Indeed, before the incorporation of Goshen, some had organized a Methodist prayer group to meet. The first sermon in Goshen was preached in some unfinished building, however the first Methodist Episcopal church was built shortly after in 1833. However, this is not the present church, which was not built until 1875 by Chicagoan architect Cass Chapman who also designed many buildings in Elkhart and Princeton university.  The Methodist church has a history of providing services for the community of Goshen. For example, the incorporation of the town of Goshen did not include a cemetery, and the Methodists, feeling it was unfitting, decided to buy one for themselves and other religious organizations to bury the dead. Similarly, Methodists spotted a need to minister to the deaf early, and from 1915 onwards they hosted a deaf congregation lead by a deaf preacher by the name of Philip J. Hasenstab, until his death in 1941.|\nResidential District |IMG_5218.png|Masonic Temple (c. 1929),|301 S. Fifth St.,|41.583452|-85.833342|If the Masonic Temple feels morbid you, it should. Built in the Egyptian Revival style to resemble a mausoleum, it attains this effect by the flat roof and tall walls without many windows. Notable are the classical windows with two women on front, one portraying Charity on the right, and the other, Light.|Despite its funerary appearance, the Masons have a vibrant historical life within Goshen. The first meetings of the Grand Masons in Goshen were held in the old county courthouse, but soon moved across the street on the east side of main street. However, membership grew quickly in Goshen, and soon the Grand Masonic Lodge began looking to purchase a lot to build upon. Quickly they raised funds, and by 1929 they had built this building, the front decorated with masonic symbols and bible verses as well as ornate doors.   The Masons were successful beyond the growth of their organization. In the 1940s they were commended for their effective sale of war bonds. Similarly they provided their building to many other organizations hoping to use it for fundraising, and it still may be accessed as such. This lot has a history beyond the Masons; namely, it was also the birthplace of the renowned filmmaker Howard Hawks, who made classics such as Scarface and Sergeant York.|\nResidential District |IMG_5217.png|Old Goshen High School (1903)|310 S. Fifth St.,|41.583133|-85.832904|The old Goshen High School is an excellent example of a Mediterranean Revival building. Designed symmetrically and simply, the archways decorated with limestone cartouches stand out along with the mediterranean style roof. Similarly, the brick pilasters also add to the revival flare of the building. |The old Goshen High School was once known as the Emma Chandler building, for a schoolteacher and principal by the name of Emma Chandler. Indeed, it is very possible, without her efforts, a new high school may not have arrived until much later.          After attending college and seminary, Emma Chandler returned to Goshen after the civil war, and began teaching in the public school system. Indeed she was well received by the community and her students; and earlier historians note that she and another teacher, Lillian Michael, increased the enrollment in the high school from 150 to 325. This huge increase in enrollment created demand for more classrooms which helped to lead to the construction of the Old High School Building.          After the buildings completion, Emma Chandler took responsibility as the principal of the High School building, until she retired and acted as the dean of teachers.|\nResidential District |DSC_4409.png|The Mitchell House (1870)|324 S. Fifth Street,|41.582534|-85.832441|The Mitchell House is a Queen Anne style house with Eastlake decorations. Inherited from the Queen Anne style is the conical tower, the wraparound porch, and the many gables. The Eastlake influences are noticeable in the geometric patterns in the porch railing and the ornamented windows and gables.|The house however is not nearly as ornamented as its owner, the Honorable J.A.S. Mitchell. Moving to Goshen after finishing his law degree, but his time there was short as the Civil War broke out shortly afterwards and he enlisted. However, during the war he was involved in some of the most intense fighting there was, including the battle of Shiloh and the siege of Atlanta. During this time he rose through the ranks and became a captain and then an inspector general.  After the war was finished, he returned to Goshen and opened a law firm with another lawyer and future representative and judge, John Harris Baker. He worked there for several years, and eventually was elected Mayor of Goshen for two terms. Shortly thereafter in 1880 he ran as the democratic candidate for Indiana Supreme Court, and was defeated. However, defeat was only temporary, and in 1884 he won his seat on the Supreme Court, where he served for a term, before being re-elected and dying shortly thereafter.|\nResidential District |IMG_5222-a.png|First English Lutheran Church (1876)|402 S. Fifth St.,|41.582266|-85.832903|The First English Lutheran Church was built in 1876 is yet another Gothic Revival church in Goshen. However, its tall, narrow stained glass windows are uniquely beautiful, along with the wave-patterned corbelling along the eaves of the roof. Like other Gothic Revival churches, it has towers on both ends of the church.|The drama of the Gothic architecture of the First English Lutheran Church is reflective of its dramatic beginning in the 1870s. In 1875 and 1876, members of the First Evangelical Church got into a major dispute over having bilingual services. In the late 1860s and 1870s Germans began moving into Goshen, which generated the need for German speakers on the pastoral team. As a result, a group of disgruntled members left the church and began the First English Evangelical Lutheran Church, holding their first sermon on February 20, 1876.|\nResidential District |DSC_4408.png|The Baker House (c. 1875)|401 S. Fifth St.,|41.582189|-85.833224|The honorable Baker house was owned by the Honorable John Harris Baker. An Italianate row house, its noticeable features include tall, narrow windows with elaborate window crowns, a large stone eaves held up by massive corbels, and complex cornices.|The opulent nature of the house is reflected from the opulent nature of the master. Baker served as a lawyer and a public notary. He went to serve as a state senator, except he held the office of public notary simultaneously, and Indiana law prevented him from holding to public offices at the same time. Yet, this experience whet his hunger to serve, and in 1872 ran to be a Representative in the U.S. Congress, only to lose. However, running again in 1874, Baker was successful, and proceeded to serve three terms in the House of Representatives.  During this time he made a number of allies in Washington including Chester A. Arthur, who desired Baker to be second assistant postmaster general. However, Baker refrained wishing to work primarily in law. As such when he was offered the position of U.S. District Court Judge by Benjamin Harrison, he accepted and was quickly appointed by the Congress. He served as a judge until 1902, when he finally retired. |\nResidential District |DSC_4404.png|Romanesque Revival House (c. 1900)|412 S. Fifth St.|41.581818|-85.83243|This house, built around 1901, has a palatial feeling. In particular, the conical roof and tower feel not dissimilar from a castle. On the outside, the enormous curved wraparound porch with simple columns recall the Romanesque Revival style in which the home was built. |This lovely home was built by another man involved in the lumber trade, Charles C. Piatt. Piatt served as an office worker for a number of lumber companies, until he eventually wound up as the superintendent of Sanders & Egbert lumber company in 1902. Similarly, he was involved in the Wakarusa telephone exchange, and served as a vice-president on its board.  However, the home itself was built upon a corrupted foundation. Indeed, in a letter to an architect, Piatt mentions that they have already selected a cornerstone for the house that could be perfect if it were dressed up: an African Americans headstone. In this regard, this reflects a tragic but historical reality: the failure of to adequate value black persons in America.|\nResidential District |DSC_4401.png|Prairie-Style House (c. 1920)|414 S. Fifth St.,|41.581608|-85.832416|This Prairie style home, built circa 1920, is reminiscent of the homes of Frank Lloyd Wright. Critically, it is designed with a horizontal, rather than vertical, emphasis. This is reflected in the wood banding decorating the circumference of the home; also significant are the large overhanging eaves. ||\nResidential District |DSC_4405.png|The Simmons House (1899)|419 S. Fifth Street,|41.581418|-85.833299|The Simmons House was built in the delightful Queen Anne style around 1899. Noticeable is its classical balcony and front porch, decorated with columns. The palladian windows, decorated gables and leaded windows also recall the ornation common of Queen Anne homes.|The primary occupant of this house was the man Isaac Simmons. He primarily worked as a deputy attorney for the county of Goshen and was apparently somewhat successful. Also fascinatingly, he apparently served in the Civil War when he was 17 and under age a drummer boy.

Fifth St., |41.578242|-85.832435|The Wickham House was built in 1857 in the Italianate style. This is manifest in the low pitch roof with large eaves held up by paired brackets or corbels. Similarly, the windows are narrow and tall, topped with triangular pediments.

He first began work in 1847, and his practice continued for another 33 years until 1880.|\nResidential District |IMG_5208.png|St. James Episcopal Church (1862)|105 S. Sixth Street|41.586156|-85.831866|The St. James Episcopal Church is yet another Gothic Revival church, but suiting its anglican roots also makes use of the plain English style. This is reflected in the steeple-less tower and the mostly undecorated exterior. Similarly, gothic influences are clear from the narrow windows and the pointed archways. |The Anglican Congregation in Goshen wasnt organized until 1859, and the church was not built until 1861. Supposedly, the church was named by a churchman who was homesick for his former church in New York, St. James Church. However, the church underwent many changes after its initial construction, with windows being replaced with stained glass and the slow completion of its interior. Amusingly, the churchs pipe organ came from a man known as Dean Pletcher or Mike Kelly; he raised funds for the organ by conducting stunt performances. |\nResidential District |DSC_4385.png|The Hughes House (c. 1855)|108 S. 6th Street,|41.586068|-85.830979|This Early Italianate house built in 1855, reflects the common characteristics of its style: large overhanging eaves, a flat roof and coupled corbels.

Sixth Street|41.585322|-85.831391|The former First Baptist Church is like most other churches in Goshen designed in the Gothic revival style. Its pointed narrow windows and towers keeps in line with the other keep-like designs of Goshen churches. However, what is unique about this building, is that it went from being a gothic church to a gothic home and is now a private residence. |The first Baptist congregation in was the third congregation to be organized in Goshen, with records of meetings appearing as early as 1836 under the name the First Regular Baptist Church. However, in 1858, the eight women organized a meeting place within a building, and the church began to meet at a regular time and location. Shortly after this, the congregation had grown large enough that they had to establish a new church, so in 1876 they built the First Baptist Church. Fascinatingly, the lot this building was built upon was the same site as the first building in Goshen, Henry Bissells log cabin. After nearly a century there, the First Baptist Church moved again, and the building before you was transferred over to a private residence. |\nResidential District |DSC_4398.png|The Harris-Penrod House (c. 1894)|202 S. Sixth St.|41.58491|-85.831065|The Harris-Penrod house is a large Late Queen Anne style building, with all the features and regality expected. The large wrap-around porch, columns, and the balcony all are notable architectural features which indicate the luxurious status of the home and the affluence of its namesake owners. | The first owner, Charles B. Harris was a Goshen native, who had lived there all his life; save for a tiny period spent serving in the Civil War. After being discharged for disability he engaged in banking, farming, and work as a traveling salesman before serving on the State Board of Agriculture from 1892 - 1897. However, his life was about to take a surprising cosmopolitan turn: in 1897 he left his hometown, serving as a consulate in Nagasaki for four years and then six more years in Reichmann Austria, only to move to Los Angeles. Indeed, he never returned home until his ashes were interned at a Goshen cemetery in 1934.   The other early owner, John N. Penrod, also lived a life of authority. The head of a lumber company, he spent many years working for the Lesh, Penrod and Abbot Company, before being the primary owner of Penrod Lumber Company, Although little is known of him besides this.|\nResidential District |DSC_4396.png|The Gortner House (1862)|203 S. Sixth St.,|41.584868|-85.831716|The Gortner house is a mixture of italianate and georgian design. The overhanging eaves upheld by corbels reflect the Italian influences, while the front entranceway is of the Georgian family, and was likely added later. Formerly, there was a wraparound porch, but sadly that has been removed.|The Gortner House was built in 1862 for the Gortner Family. Indeed, it stayed in the family for four generations and many years. Mr. Gortner co-owned a manufacturing firm with his brother which produced agricultural implements, which was greatly successful. In the late 1800s, the Gortner house was apparently a busy and joyous place, with many dances being performed within the house for the family.

He came to give a speech intended to sway Goshen residents to support the then democratic presidential nominee, Williams Jennings Bryant and his platform of free silver.|\nResidential District |DSC_4392.png|The Lesh House (1897)|213 S. 6th,|41.58427|-85.831821|Another Late Queen Anne style home, the Lesh House displays again distinctive elements of the style. Recognizable from other Queen Anne style homes are the classical columns, the wraparound porch, and large gables; also significant is the rounded tower with a conical slate roof.|However, the eloquence continues indoorswithin, the house is filled with fine woodworking, indicative of the Lesh family heritage. The owner of the home, Joseph Lesh, was the son of John Lesh, a lumber baron. The Lesh family operated over a huge range of land, being active in Indiana, the Iowa and Arkansas territories and neighboring states. Such was the range of business, that John Lesh became known as the King of the Walnut Business. Furthermore, the Leshs exercised a fair amount of power in Goshen, with John Lesh serving as mayor of the town for a term.   Joseph, continued in his fathers footsteps working with the company to help maintain and expand the company.

Sixth St.,|41.582941|-85.831814|The Boyer-Hyde House was built in 1890 and remains a gorgeous Queen Anne style home.

The fish scale and clapboard siding are some of the more unique features of the house, with the curved porch and round turret more representative of the general style.|For such a distinctive looking house, it is important to recognize the distinctive characters which lived within: The Honorable Aldo J. Simpson and his wife, Mae Simpson. Aldo J. Simpson was an important figure in Goshen, who serving as a prosecuting attorney, Goshen city attorney, and as county chairman of the Republican party. However, in 1932 he was appointed as judge in the Elkhart Circuit of the Indiana Circuit Court. Still more impressive than the title is the fact that he served on the bench for 44 consecutive years, longer than any other judge in Indiana history.  Mrs. Simpson was equally involved in politics, serving in the Republican Party and was involved in a variety of projects. Similarly significant, Mae Simpson was a noted suffragette, standing outside polling stations in 1918 requesting signatures for a petition granting women the right to vote.

Sixth St.,|41.579871|-85.831632|Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church is yet another Gothic Revival church in Goshen. The gothic influence is reflected in the hall-like structure of the church, the pointed arch openings and windows, the stone decorations and of course the bell tower ramparts. The bas relief stonework over the entrances are also beautiful. |Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church housed the earliest Lutheran congregation in Goshen, which was organized in 1861, with the church being built in 1862. Due to the migration of German Lutherans to Goshen, they began hosting services in both German and English, which lead to the start of a major dispute between the congregation, with a few members leaving to start First English Lutheran Church. Indeed, the German services were such a part of the heritage of this church that they continued until World War I, when anti-german sentiment lead to the end of the practice.   The church also attracted the eye of notable philanthropists. Around the turn of the century, Andrew Carnegie agreed to help the church purchase a pipe organ for the church, which pleased much of the congregation.|\nResidential District ||Craftsman House (c. 1920)|716 S.

Eighth St.|41.585864|-85.828472|The Thompson house is doubly rare as one of the few Gothic Revival and double homes in Goshen.
